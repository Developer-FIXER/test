In Python, the random module is a built-in module that provides functions for generating pseudo-random numbers. These numbers are "pseudo" because they are not truly random but are generated by a deterministic algorithm based on an initial "seed" value. Despite this, they are suitable for most common applications, including simulations, games, and cryptographic uses where true randomness isn
